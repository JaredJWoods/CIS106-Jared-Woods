# CIS106-Jared-Woods
My name is Jared Woods.
I am taking this course to satisfy the requirements for Electronics Engineer Tech AAS.  I needed to find a new career quickly and felt comfortable around electricity, technology, and troubleshooting. This degree seemed like a good fit.  I like to learn as much as I can about anything I am doing because I have enough curiosity to get myself in trouble.
